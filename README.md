## Included Parts: 
**Command Pod**, roughly same size as Mk1; Looking for an IVA Has data transmitter built-in. Two variants depending on other active mods.

       * KAS (pre 1.2): adds front mounted winch unit w 30 meter cable.
       * SCANSat: adds small SCANSat network uplink unit w/ BTDT scanner and MapTraq modules.
       * B9nodeSwitch adds additional attachment node choices

**Advanced Drone Unit**, derived from the Command Pod. Crew space converted to service bay. More EC and Mono capacity. Integrated RCS thrusters. One variant available

       * RemoteTech: *Service bay removed.* Adds 500km passive Omni antenna and 9Mm directional antenna, should allow comfortable operation within Kerbin SOI. Increased EC and Mono capacity. Integral RTG will prevent complete loss of control from lack of EC; but will require periodic recharge with additional power sources.
